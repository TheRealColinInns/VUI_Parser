VUI PARSER
=================================================

This repository contains my solution to the task provided to me in the VUI HW file. 

To run please use command line arguments with the driver class. Provide a -input flag followed by a URL pointing to a text based page in order to run. There is additionally a optional command line arument that allows a user to have the results printed to a specified location using the format -results followed by the path in which the user would like the results. If the flag is not provided the results will be printed by defualt to a file named results in the directory the user is running the project in.
